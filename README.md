# Comparative Study of GCN and HGConv: Structure, Features, and Noise

This repository contains code and results for the project **"Comparative Study of GCN and HGConv: Structure, Features, and Noise"**, conducted as part of the **Artificial Intelligence** course final project at Seoul National University.

The goal of this project is to systematically compare **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)** and **Hypergraph Convolution (HGConv)** models under various conditions, focusing on structural generalization and robustness to input perturbations.

Each directory includes:

- A Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) that runs the corresponding experiments.
- A `Figures/` folder that stores the resulting plots from both clean and corrupted input settings.

## 🧪 Experiments Overview

We evaluated GCN and HGConv models under two experimental settings:

1. **Clean Setting**  
   - **Datasets**: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, BAShapes (with and without node features)  
   - **Hyperedge Construction**: 1-hop neighbors, k-NN (cosine similarity)  
   - **Evaluation Metric**: Test accuracy at the epoch of best validation performance  
   - For BAShapes (with features), node features were synthetically generated by sampling from class-dependent Gaussian distributions with mean shifts proportional to their labels.

2. **Robustness Setting**  
   - **Datasets**: Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed  
   - **Hyperedge Construction**: 1-hop neighbors only  
   - **Evaluation Metric**: Test accuracy at the epoch of best validation performance  
   - **Corruption Types**:
     - **Feature Noise**: Add Gaussian noise (σ = 0.1) to node features  
     - **Structural Perturbation**: Randomly add or remove 5% of edges  
     - **Label Noise**: Flip 10% of training labels

All models use 2-layer GCN or HGConv architectures implemented in PyTorch Geometric (PyG).

## 📊 Key Results

| Dataset                  |           Clean Setting        |      Feature Noise Setting     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Cora                     | GCN ≈ HGConv-1hop > HGConv-kNN | HGConv-1hop > GCN (**+14.8%**) |
| Citeseer                 | GCN ≈ HGConv-1hop > HGConv-kNN | HGConv-1hop > GCN (**+8.6%**)  |
| Pubmed                   | GCN ≈ HGConv-1hop > HGConv-kNN | HGConv-1hop > GCN (**+15.1%**) |
| BAShapes                 | GCN > HGConv-1hop ≈ HGConv-kNN | -                              |
| BAShapes (with features) | HGConv-kNN > HGConv-1hop > GCN | -                              |

- **In label-derived feature settings, the choice of hyperedges strongly influences model performance.**
- **HGConv-1hop demonstrates consistently stronger robustness to input corruption compared to GCN across all datasets.**
